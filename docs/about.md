### <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

Chameleon is a collection of patterns and front-end files that are used across the front-end of Pusher's products. The long-term goal, is to slowly migrate our existing repos (splash, dash, blog etc), to use one code base.

### Isn't this overcomplicating things?

CSS is a super easy language to write, which makes it very hard to manage. Chameleon has several core aims:
- Make it easier to get started on 'Pusher' projects. Projects that require front-end assets, such as colors and form elements, are already defined in Chameleon. Just include the required repo (npm/gem) and you're away.
- Reduce repetition. There are many patterns that are shared across projects. Chameleon aims to reduce the need to have to update the same code in different places.
