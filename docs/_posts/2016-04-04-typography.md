We have two core fonts that we use: `Radjhani` and `PT Mono`.

Radjhani is used for titles and copy, whereas PT Mono is used for highlight elements such as buttons and spans.

There are no base typography classes. Everything is inherited through the heading tags.

<div class="pattern">
  <h1>H1 - Page title</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>H2 - Section title</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>H3 - Section sub-title</h3>
  <br>
  <h4>H4 - Paragraph title</h4>
  <br>
  <h6>H6 - Heading</h6>
</div>

``` html
<h1>H1 - Page title</h1>
<h2>H2 - Section title</h2>
<h3>H3 - Section sub-title</h3>
<h4>H4 - Paragraph title</h4>
<h6>H6 - Heading</h6>
```
