#### Primary Colors
These are our primary colors. We prefer to use our main colours sparingly to help highlight elements.

<div class="grid grid--collapse">
  <div class="grid__small-12 grid__medium-4 grid__columns">
    <div class="color-block cb-primary">
      <span>$color-primary</span>
      <span>#549eff</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__small-12 grid__medium-4 grid__columns">
    <div class="color-block cb-secondary">
      <span>$color-secondary</span>
      <span>#977fda</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__small-12 grid__medium-4 grid__columns">
