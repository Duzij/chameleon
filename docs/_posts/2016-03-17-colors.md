These are our primary colors. We prefer to use our main colours sparingly to help highlight elements.

<div class="grid grid--collapse">
  <div class="grid__small-12 grid__medium-4 grid__columns">
    <div class="color-block cb-primary">
      <span>$color-primary</span>
      <span>#549eff</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__small-12 grid__medium-4 grid__columns">
    <div class="color-block cb-secondary">
      <span>$color-secondary</span>
      <span>#977fda</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__small-12 grid__medium-4 grid__columns">
    <div class="color-block cb-developer">
      <span>$color-developer</span>
      <span>#21d3c1</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

We also have a defined palette of neutral colors:

<div class="grid grid--collapse">
  <div class="grid__small-12 grid__medium-4 grid__columns">
    <div class="color-block cb-white">
      <span>$color-white</span>
      <span>#ffffff</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__small-12 grid__medium-4 grid__columns">
     <div class="color-block cb-off-white">
      <span>$color-off-white</span>
      <span>#f4f8fb</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__small-12 grid__medium-4 grid__columns">
     <div class="color-block cb-black">
      <span>$color-black</span>
      <span>#2b303b</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
